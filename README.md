# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> Data Visualization: Excel, Graph Maker, Databox etc.
Expense/Budgeting Calculation: Honeydue, Mint, Pocketguard etc.
Mobile Banking Integration: i-Con, IVR, etc.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user, I should be able to track my expenses/receipts
As a user, I should be able to reliably calculate the differences in my purchases
As a user, I should be able to see a comprehensive list of transactions and savings

- What are the app milestones

> Registration and login -> Credit Card Integration -> Bank Account Integration -> Offline Behavior

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Security, Privacy, Reliability, Ease of access

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes as long as it doesn't need to connect to banking apps immediately

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Make it a tracker of receipts and purchases so that you can "round up" later

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Gamification

- How could people misuse this application?

> Accessing other people's data due to low security

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Potential risk of breaching private banking information

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> React, Javascript, Web hosting, Web servers, Live chat

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user, I should be able to register an account
As a user, I should be able to highlight my interests
As a user, I should be able to text or voice chat with others

- What are the app milestones

> Registration/Profiles -> Chat integration -> Voice integration -> Ratings -> Tag refinement

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Safety, User verfication

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Not feasible

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Instead of talking to another human and needing the technologies to do so, you could talk to a bot

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Gamification (badges, coins, ratings etc)

- How could people misuse this application?

> Could be used for malicious actions (bullying)

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Yes through inappropriate behavior

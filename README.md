# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> ReactJS, Javascript, Nodejs

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Not sure, maybe

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A user will be able to manually add the change from each purchase as they are made.
  A user will be able to tally their total savings daily.
  A user will be able to automatically add their electronic savings from each purchase as they are made.
  A user will be able to create a saving, edit it, view an item of savings added, view a daily list of saving items and delete an item if necessary.

- What are the app milestones

> The milestone would be achieving full crud capability with the app 

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Accuracy since the manual operation leaves open the possibility of human errors as well of security if it is to be attached to bank accounts.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> No its not.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> No more time would be needed to use the app while making puchases.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> It could be made to be the app that acts as the transactor of purchases and so it would always be used in a purchase. It would accept the price, do the round up, subtract then rounded amount from a card or bank, pay for the item and deposit the est into savings. All the user would see is a purchase was made but it would be involved in all purchases.

- How could people misuse this application?

> With crud capability they could decide when they want to use the app and even how much they want to add to savings which would defeat the purpose of the app.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> The data the app is using is itself sensitive and thus managing this would have safety implications.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> React, node, jquery, voice chat capability

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Database analyzer that works in real time, jquery, telephony

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A user will be able to log in with a topic and mood
  A user once connected will be able to discuss by text or voice their topic with another user sharing this interest
  A user will remain anonymous during their chat sessions
  A user can rate their chat sessions

- What are the app milestones

> A milestone may be the option to reconnect with a previous user while still remaining anonymous as maybe the topic is one the is ongoing past one conversation.

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> the quick ability of the app to recognize when information such as addresses names or even emails are being divulged to block them

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> it could be

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Removing the voice feature may make its testing more practical.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Their could be prizes or giveaways based on hours of use

- How could people misuse this application?

> they could divulge personal details that damages the anonymity the app boasts.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Yes people's safety is at risk if their identity is unveiled.

# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> React(.js or React Native), a banking api, database(SQL, ETC.), Authentication, Server,

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes, SQL, Rust and Python (or Java, or R.. some other programming language )

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user I can see the how much was used to round up
> As a user I can login
> As a user I can transfer money
> As a user I can see changes in the account


- What are the app milestones

> 1. fetch to bank API
> 2. Creation of authentication 
> 3. Save data
> 4. Transfer money
> 5. Password encryption
> 6. Able to check account checking and account routing numbers

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> App desgin
> Devices that can run the app
> Friendly UI/UX
> 

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> If we have a bigger team, yes

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Push notifications

- How could people misuse this application?

> Steal user info/personal data, 

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Cybersecurity related issue

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> React(.js or React Native)
> Database(SQL, ETC.)
> Authentication
> Server 
> end-to-end encryption 
> Socket Programming 

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Network Layout
> SQL
> Rust
> Python (or Java, or R.. some other programming language )


- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user I can to login or not 
> As a user I can choose to give less personal info to the server as possible.
> 

- What are the app milestones

> CRUD forums
> Socket programming 
> End-to-end encyption 
> Database
> Servers
> UI/UX design 

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Target audience 
> Server population 

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Yes,

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Anonymous system 

- How could people misuse this application?

> Various types of tools to destroy servers (DDOS, ETC..)

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Community Standards
> Filtering IP

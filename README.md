# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> React/JavaScript, HTML, Basic Math, Local Storage or Server Side

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Either having the data Locally or setting up a Server

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user I want every purchase to be rounded up and moved to a savings account.
> As a user I want to put my purchase information into a form.
> As a user I want to choose whether to round up my currently entered purchase.
> As a user I want to see a confirmation of how much was moved to my savings account.

- What are the app milestones

> Able to calculate money saved per transation.
> Working form to enter information with confirmation.

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Presentation and Styling, Responsiveness, App Security, Authentication

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> The MVP seems feeasable for a hackathon.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> The idea is good enough to be done as is.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Appeal to their need for money, promotional material.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Attempt to put in false bank information, Using other peoples bank information to "steal" money

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> People can attempt to steal others bank information to try and funnel money into their account.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> P2P or Serverside Connection, End to End Encryption, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user I want to be able to select a topic I want to chat about.
> As a user I want to be matched with people I have a topic in common with.
> As a user I want to be able to send and receive a message from my chat partner.
> As a user I want to be able to rate my discussion after it ends.

- What are the app milestones

> Created Peer 2 Peer connection
> Form for Chat and chat-log
> Sucessful encryption of messages

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Lack of users.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> We currently dont have the skills/experience to make this app feasible for a hack-a-thon

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> No.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> App notifications, Encourage with a new prompt. Highlight person connection

- How could people misuse this application?

> Chat Robots, Scam Artists,

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> User doxxing, Harassment
